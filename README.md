NYT React Search

Overview

In this activity, you'll create a new React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later.

Instructions

Create a MongoDB database called nytreact.
Using mongoose, then create an Article schema and model
At a minimum, articles should have each of the following fields:

title (Title of the stored article from nytimes.com)
date (publish date and time of the article)
url (URL of the article on nytimes.com)

This application uses the MERN setup.  Technologies involved are MongoDB, Express, React, Axios, and Node.  The purpose of this application is retrieving or "scraping" the New York Times api.  The user can put any topic in the field along with the start and end dates and hit submit. The application then goes and retrieves the data on that topic the user put in and displays it. The user can then click the links to those articles as well as click the save button to the article they want to keep. The user can also click on the "saved articles" button and view the articles they have saved as well as delete them at will.
